                <h5>The Safer Stops Pouch</h5>
                    <h6>The Safer Stops Pouch was developed to give my daughter and son an extra measure of safety if pulled over by police. The necessity to reach, search or dig in pockets, purses or glove compartments for credentials is eliminated from an already tense situation. <br />
                    The Safer Stops Pouch is octagonal in shape to emphasize the word stop as well to let others know it is not a wallet. The Safer Stops Pouch holds your proof of insurance, license and registration. It is mounted on the steering wheel cowel or dash behind the steering wheel with a reusable gel pad. The gel pad does not harm the surface it is attached to. <br />
                    The Safer Stops Pouch benefits police officers as well. If drivers only need to reach as far as the steering column to retrieve credentials their hands remain in site of the officer at all times. Simple.
                    Safer Stops for all.</h6>
